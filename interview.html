    <h1>Interview with Ghost Bike Volunteer</h1>
    1. How long have you lived in New York City?




    2. How often do you ride a bike in the city? And how does it compare to your experiences using other modes of transport (e.g., walking, public transit, cars)?




    3. How do you think the experience of riding a bike in the city has changed during the time you’ve been riding here?




    4. When and how did you first learn about ghost bikes? Can you share your initial/early thoughts and reactions to them?




    5. How did you get involved with the ghost bike project?




    6. Can you explain the process behind the creation of a ghost bike? How do you learn about cyclist deaths? And then how does the bike get made and placed?




    7. Does the ghost bike activist group receive any funding or donations? If not, how do you cover the costs of your work?




    8. Since your time working with ghost bikes, has the group ever wanted to place a ghost bike somewhere, but it was ultimately not placed? If so, can you explain why?




    9. Have you had any experiences with a ghost bike—either in being part of its creation and placement or in bearing witness to it separate from its creation and placement—that stand out to you in particular? If so, please explain.




    10. What do you see as the purpose—or purposes—of the creation and placement of ghost bikes? Do you think it changes over time?




    11. Is there any recourse for when you learn about a ghost bike having been removed?




    12. Based on your work with ghost bikes, what are the most important things that you want people to know about them, especially for people who may just be hearing about ghost bikes for the first time?




    13. About how many people are involved in your ghost bike activist group in New York City? Are there other groups active in the creation and placement of ghost bikes in the city?




    14. Is there a common profile among the people involved with ghost bikes (for instance, relatives of victims, activists, etc.)?




    15. Is your group in touch with other ghost bike groups in other parts of the country or globe?




    16. Have you been able to gauge the impact of your activism on the general public? If so, can you provide some examples of this impact?




    17. Is the ghost bike group active also at the level of policy change? If so, can you elaborate on this?




    18.How might people who come to this digital memory project be involved in your group or your cause?




    19. Is there anything else you want to share about biking in New York City or about ghost bikes?
