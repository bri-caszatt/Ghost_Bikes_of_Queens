        <h2>Organizing a Ghost Bike Workday</h2>
        <p>Below is a general overview of the planning and work that go into the creation and installation of ghost bikes, adapted from a file shared by Steve during <a href="interview.html">our interview</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>Setting the Date</h3>
            <p>First, set a date with the office of the public official (who donated their backyard to work in). Saturdays and Sundays are both OK, but someone from the office needs to be available to open up and lock up.</p>
            <p>Also, check the MTA website to make sure there are no scheduled issues for the date selected, because volunteers will be using the subway to transport completed ghost bikes to crash sites for installation. The MTA website has diversions for the next 30 days.</p>
        
        <h3>Getting Bikes</h3>
            <p>Determine how many bikes are needed. No more than 8 at a time&#8212;it will be crowded in the backyard if we do more than that.</p>
            <p>Contact Recycle A Bicycle. They will supply as many bikes as needed and deliver them, usually the Thursday or Friday before the workday. Someone from the Ghost Bike Project should be there to accept the bikes. Wheel them into the backyard, and put a tarp over them.</p>

        <h3>Supply Inventory</h3>
            <p>Take an inventory of supplies in the storage containers stacked at the worksite.</p>
            <p>Check for &ldquo;Cyclist Killed Here&rdquo; plaques, bolts and nuts, spray paint, sandpaper, tarps, chain, and locks.</p>
        
        <h3>Supply Run</h3>
            <p>Do a supply run. You&rsquo;ll need a vehicle for this. Fill in the gaps of what&rsquo;s missing.</p>
            <p>We need:
                <ul>
                    <li>three cans of Rustoleum painters touch 2x paint x primer flat white for each bike</li>
                    <li>6 feet of chain for each bike If the bike is being chained to a &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo; sign; 9 to 10 feet if the bike is being chained to a lamppost</li>
                    <li>one lock per bike, any standard padlock is OK</li>
                    <li>sandpaper</li>
                    <li>some kind of green cleaning solution</li>
                    <li>at least two tarps, maybe three</li>
                    <li>cord, rope, or bungees to secure tarps</li>
                    <li>large trash bags</li>
                    <li>nuts and bolts to attach plaques to parking sign posts</li>
                    <li>if a bike is going on a lamppost, then buy a circular hose clamp about 10 inches in diameter, and some sturdy wire to hang the plaque from</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>If there aren&rsquo;t enough plaques at the worksite, there is a supply of metal &ldquo;Cyclist Killed Here&rdquo; plaques in the Transportation Alternatives office. Take as many plaques as needed for the workday, and bring them back to the worksite. They will fit in a good-sized messenger bag, so they can be transported by bike, but they&rsquo;re also kind of heavy. Five to seven is about as many as can be comfortably carried by bike.</p>
            <p>For tools, use whatever you and the other volunteers have. You WILL need a pedal wrench, a set of Allen wrenches, a crescent wrench, vise grip pliers, and Phillips-head and flathead screwdrivers. Bolt cutters or something that cuts metal is also useful. We have two bolt cutters.</p>

        <h3>Workday</h3>
            <p>Recruiting volunteers: We have a Google group and a Facebook page, and we recruit from the Transportation Alternatives Borough committees. We usually get a pretty good response.</p>
            <p>First volunteer job is to buy coffee and donuts for volunteers. Maybe pizza and drinks for lunch later.</p>
            <p>Bring the supply containers out&#8212;will need two people.</p>
            <p>Put up tarps along the fence.</p>
            <p>Begin stripping bikes of anything that might be useful&#8212;pedals, lights, fenders, cables, handles, lights, reflectors, kickstands, etc. Volunteers are welcome to anything that might be useful, otherwise separate trash into recyclables and non-recyclables.</p>
            <p>Once bikes are stripped, begin prepping and spray painting. Lightly sand the bikes and then wipe them down. One good coat of paint + primer per bike should be OK.  Also, chains and locks need to be painted; spread a tarp on the ground.</p>
        
        <h3>Installs</h3>
            <p>Once bikes are dry, volunteers can transport bikes to be installed. Teams of two; bring a bike, chain, lock, key, and bolts (and, if possible, a hammer). If all crash sites are accessible by subway, then no issues. Again, check the MTA website for diversions!</p>
            <p>Bikes that aren&rsquo;t going to locations that are accessible by subway need to go by vehicle.</p>
            <p>Find a parking sign near the crash site, but try to avoid putting the bike directly in front of a business or a private home&#8212;we&rsquo;ve had problems in the past.</p>
            <p>Chain the bike to the pole as tightly as possible&#8212;try to get the chain through both wheels. Lock it up; don&rsquo;t worry about the key. If we have to move it, we can use the bolt cutters.</p>
            <p>Place the plaque as high up on the pole as possible. The holes in the plaque will line up with the holes on the pole. Bolt it, then use the hammer to bend down the bolt, so no one steals the sign.</p>
            <p>One volunteer should read the ghost bike invocation with the name of the victim (text will be distributed at the workday), and the other should video the invocation.</p>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re chaining to a lamppost, put the hose clamp around the pole, and tighten it as much as possible. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver. Use wire to hang the sign from the hose clamp.</p>

        <h3>Cleanup</h3>
            <p>Two volunteers should stay behind and clean the area as best as they can, return the supplies tubs to the office, and leave trash bags in the backyard (official&rsquo;s staff will take care of them).</p>
